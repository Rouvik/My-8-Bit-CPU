# My-8-Bit-CPU
Compilers, data sheets, resources and .circ files for my first 8-Bit CPU (Rouvik CPU - II)

## Requirements to run this project:
- <b>Logisim Evolution 3.7.2</b> (may work on other versions too)
- Load the .circ file and upload the required Microcode instructions to the microcode PLA below in logisim
- Use the rasm assembler (built for AARCH 64) to build your own hex file
- Pass the hex file to the Program ROM and use CTRL + K to run the simulation!

## How to compile rasm(Rouvik's Assembler) for your system:
Just grab any C++ compiler with std=c++11 in supported and compile the assembler.cpp
file in AssemblerSrc to get the assembler executable and that's it!

## RASM usage:
rasm [name of assembly file] [(optional) output file name]
